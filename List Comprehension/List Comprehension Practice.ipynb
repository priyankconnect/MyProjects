    "**outer_loop:** This is the outer iterable that the outer_loop_variable will loop through.\n",
    "\n",
    "**inner_loop_variable:** This is the variable used to iterate over the elements in the inner loop. It takes values from the inner iterable (e.g., list, range, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**inner_loop:** This is the inner iterable that the inner_loop_variable will loop through.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of the loops in the list comprehension follows the same order as in traditional nested loops. The outer loop is specified first, and the inner loop is specified second.\n",

    "Here's a step-by-step example using the general format:\n",
    "\n",
