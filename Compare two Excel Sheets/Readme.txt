To compare two Excel sheets and extract the uncommon rows between them, you can follow these steps:

Load the Excel Sheets: Use pandas to read the Excel files into DataFrames.
Merge the DataFrames: Use an outer join to merge the two DataFrames. This will combine all rows from both sheets, and where there isn't a match, the non-matching DataFrame will have NaN values.
Filter the Merged DataFrame: Filter the merged DataFrame to only keep rows where there are NaN values for either of the original DataFrames. These rows are the uncommon ones.
Store the Result: Optionally, you can save the resulting DataFrame to a new Excel file.
Here's a function that implements the above steps. The function takes in the paths to the two Excel files, the names of the sheets you want to compare (assuming they're the first sheet by default), and an optional key column to use for comparison. If no key is provided, the function will compare entire rows.
