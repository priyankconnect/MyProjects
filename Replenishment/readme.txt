Conditions Underwhich No Allocation can be done
1. Missing Store Data: If the store DataFrame does not contain any data for stores (i.e., it is empty), the code will not be able to allocate stock to any store since there are no stores to allocate stock for.

2. Empty 'gap' Column: The 'gap' column in the store DataFrame represents the demand-supply gap for each item in a store. If the 'gap' column is empty or contains all zero values, it means there is no demand or gap to fulfill, and the code will not perform any allocation.

3. Missing Stock Data: If the dc DataFrame (representing stock at the distribution center) does not contain any data or is empty, there will be no stock available for allocation, and the code won't be able to perform any allocation.

4. No Positive Quantity Items: If the dc DataFrame contains items with zero or negative quantities, it means there is no stock available for allocation, and the code will not be able to perform any allocation.

5. No Overlapping Items: If there are no common items between the store DataFrame and the dc DataFrame based on the columns used for merging (e.g., 'Brand', 'Craft', 'Price_Level', etc.), there won't be any items to allocate, and the code won't perform any allocation.

6. Empty Allocation Results: If the allocation process doesn't result in any items being allocated (e.g., due to insufficient stock, no suitable matches, or conflicts in allocations), the final DataFrame will be empty, and the code might not raise any error, but it might lead to incorrect results.

7. Missing Store Data in stsoh1: The stsoh1 DataFrame is used to filter out items that should not be allocated to a store because they are already present in that store's stock. If the stsoh1 DataFrame is missing or does not contain relevant data for the store, the allocation process might include items that should have been excluded.

8. These are some examples of insufficient data that might lead to issues with the stock allocation code. It's essential to validate the input data carefully, handle empty or missing data gracefully, and implement appropriate checks to ensure that the allocation process proceeds correctly. Additionally, incorporating error handling and appropriate messaging can help identify and address potential issues related to insufficient data.
